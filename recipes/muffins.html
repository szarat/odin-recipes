    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ripe mashed bananas</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup creamy almond butter</li>
        <li>2 cups of old fashioned oats</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    
      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine all of the ingredients together in a mixing bowl with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li>The cookie dough will be more wet since there is no flour. Itâ€™s slightly more difficult to work with. 
            To help with this, refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes before forming into cookies.</li>
        <li>Scoop the dough with a medium sized cookie scoop. Place the dough in between your hands to 
            squeeze it together and roll it to form a dough ball. Then, gently press to flatten. Place 
            it on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat until all the dough has been used. 
            You can also just drop spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet and shape each spoonful into a cookie-like shape.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ol>
